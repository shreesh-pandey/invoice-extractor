**Commit:** Fallback item value to "TATES" when NAB item is missing  
**Description:**  
Updated the item extraction logic to check for a line starting with "NAB ". If not found, the item value is now defaulted to `"TATES"` instead of being left blank. This change ensures consistent Excel output even when the expected item format is missing from the invoice text.

**Commit:** Update UI labels and parsers: Rename CVS to Longs Drug, remove Target  
**Description:**  
- Renamed dropdown label "CVS" to "Longs Drug" to reflect correct customer naming.  
- Removed "Target" from dropdown and parser list as it is not used.  
- Parser for "Longs Drug" remains mapped to existing logic originally developed for CVS format.
